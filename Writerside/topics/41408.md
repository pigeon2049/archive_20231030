Chipmaker Onsemi forecast fourth-quarter revenue and profit below market expectations on Monday, in a sign that slowing demand for electric vehicles was beginning to hurt orders for its chips from the automotive industry. Its shares fell 4.4% in trading before the bell as the Arizona-based company supplies chips that go into drive trains of electric cars, as well as those that help with driver-assistance systems like cameras and sensors.
