**The captain of the Thai football team** [trapped in a cave for several days in 2018](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44791998)**, took his own life while at school in the UK, a coroner has ruled.**

Duangphet Phromthep was found unconscious at Brooke House College in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, on 12 February.

He [died two days later](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64646039) at Kettering General Hospital.

Following an inquest into the 17-year-old's death, a senior coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide.

In the record of inquest, Prof Catherine Mason said: "Mr Phromthep was not known to mental health services, and it is not known why he took the actions that he did.

"It could not have been foreseen or prevented.

"The police investigation has found no evidence of third-party involvement or suspicious circumstances."

Known as Dom, he had previously gained worldwide fame as the captain of The Wild Boars football team, or Moo Pa in Thai.

He and his teammates became trapped in caves after a sudden storm caused flooding which blocked the exit.

Dom turned 13 while trapped in the cave and images of the boys were beamed across the world.

The boys and their 25-year-old coach spent nine days in darkness without food before they were found by an international search and rescue effort involving about 10,000 people.

Dom was a student at Brooke House College in Market Harborough

Dom's inquest was opened on 22 February and concluded on 4 October at Leicester Coroner's Court.

He had enrolled as a student in the football academy at Brooke House College last year.

Principal Ian Smith said: "Our entire college community remains united in grief with Dom's family, friends and former teammates.

"As a college, the health, wellbeing and welfare of our students is our absolute priority.

"We have robust safeguarding systems in place which enable us to provide appropriate support for students when needed, and we keep these systems under constant review so that we can do everything possible to provide the necessary support to every child.

"Since this tragedy, our dedicated pastoral team has continued to provide support to students and colleagues.

"Dom will always remain a part of the Brooke House family and will be hugely missed."
