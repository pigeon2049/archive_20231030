“We will deepen strategic co-operation and co-ordination with Russia, and we are willing to develop military relations with the US based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win co-operation,” Zhang said. But Zhang, who is second only to Chinese leader Xi Jinping in commanding the People’s Liberation Army, also accused “certain countries” of “continuing to stir trouble around the world”, criticism that was widely seen as aimed at the US. He said these countries “deliberately create turmoil, interfere in regional issues, interfere in other countries’ internal affairs and instigate colour revolutions”.
