Google’s smart thermostat can finally work directly with Apple Home using the new Matter smart home standard. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting it up.

The [Nest Thermostat](https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review) is one of the only smart thermostats that works with [the new smart home standard, Matter](https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer) (see sidebar). This means you can finally add it to [Apple Home](https://www.theverge.com/23751656/apple-home-smart-devices-gadgets-homepod-mini) natively and control it with voice commands using Siri and Apple Home automations. It is also compatible with any other Matter smart home platform, including Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings, although those platforms were already supported by the device through cloud integrations.

Adding the thermostat to Apple Home through Matter is straightforward. Here, I’ll walk you through the process. All you’ll need is a Nest Thermostat and an Apple Home Matter controller — such as a HomePod or Apple TV.

Note that this guide only applies to the Nest Thermostat 2020, not the [Nest Thermostat E](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17927274/nest-thermostat-e-uk-price-release-date-installation-heating) or [Nest Learning Thermostat](https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/11/9310313/nest-thermostat-third-generation-installation-hands-on). Currently, neither of those works with Matter. If you haven’t set up your thermostat yet, we have a guide on [how to install a Nest Thermostat](https://www.theverge.com/e/23699296).

_In settings for the Nest Thermostat in the Google Home app, tap on **Linked Matter apps & services** to generate a Matter code._

You can now control the Nest Thermostat in Apple Home and / or Google Home. You can also add it to Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, or any other Matter-compatible smart home ecosystem by following the same steps. You will need a Matter controller from that platform (such as an Amazon Echo smart speaker or Samsung SmartThings Hub), and you will use the platform’s app rather than Apple Home.

### What is Matter?

[Matter is a new smart home interoperability standard](https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer) that provides a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is designed to be [secure and private](https://csa-iot.org/developer-resource/white-paper-matter-security-and-privacy-copy/), [easy to set up](https://www.theverge.com/23823041/matter-thread-device-setup-smart-home-how-to), and widely compatible.

Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung, Matter is an [open-sourced](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip), IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol [Thread](https://www.theverge.com/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview) and currently supports over 20 device types. These include lighting, plugs and switches, thermostats, locks, security and environment sensors, refrigerators, dishwashers, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, [and more](https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung).

All of this means that if a smart home gadget you buy has the Matter logo, you can set it up and use it with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a [Matter controller](https://www.theverge.com/23390726/matter-smart-home-faq-questions-answers#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Matter%20Controller%3F). Additionally, you can control it with multiple controllers simultaneously, a feature called [multi-admin](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/all-about-choice-multi-admin-in-matter-gives-users-more-flexibility-and-unlocks-smart-home-innovation/). Once connected to an ecosystem, a device can work with any others in that ecosystem, regardless of whether it’s a Matter device.

Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some of the major platforms that support Matter, and they have all updated their compatible smart speakers, hubs, and other devices to be [Matter controllers](https://www.theverge.com/23390726/matter-smart-home-faq-questions-answers#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Matter%20Controller%3F).
