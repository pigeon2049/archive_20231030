China Evergrande Group’s winding-up hearing in Hong Kong was adjourned until Dec. 4, a High Court judge said on Monday. Evergrande, the world’s most indebted property developer with more than $300 billion of total liabilities, defaulted on its offshore debt in late 2021 and became the poster child of a debt crisis that has since engulfed China’s property sector.
