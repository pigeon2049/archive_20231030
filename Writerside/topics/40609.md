Goldman Sachs removed its forecast for a U.S. government shutdown this year given new geopolitical risks and the election of a speaker at the House of Representatives, but warned of risks in 2024.  
The brokerage's previous base case was for a shutdown for up to 2-3 weeks in the current quarter ended December, which now seems "much less likely", Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius said.
