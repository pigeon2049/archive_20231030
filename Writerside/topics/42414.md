U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday met with Saudi Arabian Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud and confirmed President Joe Bidenâ€™s commitment to support the defense of U.S. partners against threats from state and non-state actors, including those backed by Iran, the White House said.

The two men also affirmed the importance of deterring any expansion of the Israel-Hamas conflict, the White House said.
