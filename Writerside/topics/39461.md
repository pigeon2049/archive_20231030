Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the West is seeking to potentially expand the conflict in the Ukraine to the Asia-Pacific region, Russian state media reported citing comments made at a Beijing defence forum on Monday.

Speaking at the Xiangshan Forum, China's biggest military diplomacy event, Shoigu said NATO is covering up a build-up of force in the Asia-Pacific region with an "ostentatious desire for dialogue", Russia's TASS news agency reported.
