If you’re in Europe, you can pay a fee to get no ads across Meta’s products. The subscription is meant to address concerns from European Union regulators.

Meta is launching a [paid subscription](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/facebook-and-instagram-to-offer-subscription-for-no-ads-in-europe/) that will remove ads from Facebook and Instagram. The service is available throughout the European Union and will be offered for around €9.99 per month on the web or €12.99/month on iOS and Android to account for those platform’s additional fees.

The subscription is meant to address concerns by the European Union around Meta’s ad targeting and data collection practices. By making users choose between paying for the service to remove ad targeting or using the service for free but consenting to its data collection practices, Meta believes it will have more clearly and definitively met requirements under a collection of European data laws, including the Digital Markets Act and GDPR.

“We respect the spirit and purpose of these evolving European regulations, and are committed to complying with them,” Meta writes in a blog post announcing the new subscription.

Meta says it will continue to offer free access to its products for people who do not wish to pay. The company says the experience for nonpaying users will not change and its existing ad preference tools will remain available.

The ad-free subscription will only be available to people 18 and older. It will apply across all linked Facebook and Instagram accounts, but Meta will eventually charge extra for linked accounts. Starting March 1st, 2024, there will be an additional fee of €6 on the web or €8 on iOS and Android per linked account. The company says that as long as someone remains subscribed, their data will not be used for ad targeting.
