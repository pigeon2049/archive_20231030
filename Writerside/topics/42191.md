Microsoft and Gradle Enterprise have collaborated to develop a Build Server for Gradle in Visual Studio Code. This new feature aims to address issues with Gradle projects, such as the output location of compiled files and suboptimal support for code generation. The Build Server for Gradle utilizes the Build Server Protocol (BSP) to delegate build tasks to the Gradle build tool, ensuring consistent results with Gradle build commands. Future plans include enhancing accuracy and stability, and delegating running and testing tasks to Gradle execution.
