Claude is a text chatbot created by Anthropic that is capable of conducting product/market analysis, creating summaries for documents, extracting specific information from multiple documents, and generating code. It has more recent data than the ChatGPT free version and allows users to upload files for analysis. However, it has limitations in generating images and has a limited free plan. The pricing for the Pro version is $20 per month, the same as ChatGPT Plus.
