Spain has delivered six new multicopter drones to Senegal and plans to reinforce its deployed security personnel to help the West African nation tackle a migration crisis, Spain's acting Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said on Monday.

Grande-Marlaska is in Senegal where he met his Senegalese counterpart, Sidiki Kaba, as the number of would-be migrants from West Africa, especially Senegal, to reach Spain's Canary Islands this year is near a [record high](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/over-one-thousand-migrants-reach-spains-canary-islands-single-day-2023-10-21/).

Grande-Marlaska said the drones delivered to the Senegal Police are designed to detect vessel departures so that they could be intercepted.

He added that Spain had also deployed a civil guard aircraft to help patrol the coasts of Senegal and Mauritania, in addition to 38 troops equipped with four boats, a helicopter and 13 all-terrain vehicles that carry out joint patrol missions with Senegalese forces.

The journey from Senegal to Spain's Canary Islands is one of the deadliest [but numerous accidents](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/senegal-village-mourns-scores-lost-drifting-migrant-boat-2023-08-18/) have fail to deter people from attempting the voyage.

"We must stop his unscrupulous actions that put the lives of thousands of vulnerable people at risk," Grande-Marlaska said during a joint press conference.

Both ministers said they would increase efforts to combat illegal immigration and avoid more deaths at sea, but did not announce additional measures.
