Indian government bond yields were largely unchanged at the start of the week, as traders remained curious about the timing of the central bank's debt sale via auctions after it surprisingly raised the quantum of sales in the secondary market. The 10-year benchmark bond yield IN071833G=CC was at 7.3591% as of 10:00 a.m. after ending at 7.3576% in the previous session.
