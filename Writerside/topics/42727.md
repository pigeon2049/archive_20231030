For the second time in just as many years, Chile has a new proposed constitution after the assembly in charge of drafting it approved the final document on Monday.

The proposal was approved by 33 votes from the 50-member Constitutional Council, dominated by right-wing forces, a radical shift from the previous proposal that was drafted by left-wing and independent constituents and [overwhelmingly rejected](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chileans-head-polls-decide-progressive-new-constitution-2022-09-04/) by voters last September.
