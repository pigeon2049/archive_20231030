Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary which took place just over a week ago, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its presidential candidate according to internal rules.

The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal. The State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and "wrongfully detained" Americans by the end of November.
