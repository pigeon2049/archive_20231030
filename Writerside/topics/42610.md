Stocks traded higher Tuesday, as Wall Street tried to close out a dismal month of trading — that saw Treasury yields surge to levels not seen in more than 16 years — on a high note.

The [broader index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) rose 0.4%. The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) added 59 points, or 0.2%, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) gained 0.3%.

The S&P 500 advance was held in check mainly by communication services stocks, which was one of just two sectors trading in negative territory in afternoon trading. Notably, [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/), [Meta Platforms](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) and [Netflix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/) shares were all lower. [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) was down by more than 1%.

The [Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.VIX/) dropped to an 18 handle, below the long-term average of roughly 20. A higher VIX level can point to greater uncertainty in markets.

Earnings season continued Tuesday. [Caterpillar](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CAT/) slid more than 6% after the construction equipment maker said its fourth-quarter revenue would only be "slightly" higher than the year-ago period. [JetBlue](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JBLU/) shares dropped more than 12% after the airline's third-quarter results [missed expectations on the top and bottom lines.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/30/stock-market-today-live-updates.html#107325984-OguY18jy7)

Stocks are headed for their third-straight losing month. The Dow and the S&P 500 are down more than 1% and 2%, respectively. This marks the first three-month losing streak for both indexes since March 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has declined roughly 3% in October, also on pace for its third consecutive negative month.

S&P 500 1-month

October's losses come amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. This month, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield [breached the key 5% level for the first time since 2007.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/19/us-treasurys-ahead-of-fed-chair-powell-speech.html) Market participants attribute the rise to several factors, including concern the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer.

The Fed is set to release its next decision on interest rates on Wednesday. Fed funds futures pricing suggests a roughly 99% probability that the central bank will keep rates at current levels, according to the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html).

"If the Fed comes out and says they're probably done for the year, gives hints that they're feeling more dovish, that could be one thing that really helps," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. "But I do think you need some downward pressure on rates to actually get a more sustainable move in stocks."

Historically speaking, November is a strong month for markets, and traders are hoping seasonal tailwinds will be supportive of a year-end rally. However, they expect a peak in bond yields will be needed before they see some relief in the equity market.

Government shutdown could damage U.S. credit reputation, says economist
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A potential U.S. government shutdown is currently the biggest threat to the economy, according to The Washington Center for Equitable Growth interim chief economist Jonathan Fisher. Congress now has until Nov. 17 to reach an agreement on the federal budget.

Although Goldman Sachs estimated that a shutdown would have a limited short-term impact on economic growth, Fisher believes the bigger issue may by the potential damage it poses to the U.S.'s credit reputation.

"The last fight over the debt ceiling led Fitch to downgrade the trustworthiness of U.S. credit, and a repeat of the May showdown could snowball further from there. Downgrading the credit trustworthiness further could raise the interest rates the U.S. has to pay to issue Treasury bonds, and higher rates raise the cost of borrowing, which further constrains the U.S. budget," Fisher said.

The risk of another breakdown in budget negotiation talks should concern the Federal Reserve, he added. According to Fisher, another budget impasse could increase business and consumer uncertainty, which would slow down the economy.

JPMorgan strategist urges investors to stay defensive
-----------------------------------------------------

Investors should stay defensive as the year end approaches, according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief global equity strategist at JPMorgan.

The strategist said that the lagged effects of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes will be more dramatic than traders are currently expecting, and urged investors to hold cash and move into more resilient parts of the market. He favors utilities and health care, as well as dividend aristocrats.

"I think there's just a lag effect," he said Tuesday on CNBC's "Halftime Report." "And this time around in this cycle, the lag simply may be longer than what we're accustomed to sort of seeing in the prior cycles because of the unprecedented injection that we've got during Covid, and because of a relatively healthy starting point for things like balance sheets."

His 4,200 year-end target for the S&P 500 is just a little above where the S&P 500 closed Monday, according to the [CNBC Market Strategist Survey](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/11/market-strategist-survey-forecast.html).

Yen weakens after Bank of Japan holds rates, increases flexibility on yield curve control

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Japan's retail sales climbed 5.8%](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/statistics/tyo/syoudou/index.html) in September from a year ago, a slower expansion compared with the 7% growth seen in August.

This is the first month that the growth rate softened after four straight months of accelerating growth, and was slightly lower than the 5.9% expected by economists polled by Reuters.

Total commercial sales came up to 50.35 trillion yen ($337.17 billion) in September, its highest level since March.

Lower growth is new normal for China, HSBC says
-----------------------------------------------

China's new normal is going to be lower growth than before, said Fred Neumann, HSBC's chief Asia economist & co-head of global research.

"We probably need to adjust our expectations in terms of what the upper ceiling is for China's growth," Neumann told CNBC's "[Squawk Box Asia.](https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/)"

HSBC now sees China's economy growing 4.9% this year and 4.6% in 2024. Neumann said that will likely be the range of growth for China for the next couple of years and "that's probably as good as it gets as long as the property market continues to struggle."

Neumann said even though projections for China's growth are more modest than they were before the pandemic, there are still some signs of economic recovery underway and growing areas of investments including the electric vehicle space.

Beijing's current growth target is at 5% for 2023. Data earlier in the day showed China's manufacturing activity logged an [unexpected contraction](http://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/zxfb/202310/t20231031_1944037.html) in October.

CNBC Pro: Is Meta a buy after the brutal tech sell-off? Here's what the pros are saying
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Meta Platforms](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) saw its shares [caught up in a broad tech sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/tech-stocks-suffer-steep-two-day-drop-after-google-meta-earnings.html) last week — but several analysts remain bullish.

Meta's stock fell 3.86% last week, although was trading over 2% higher Monday.

"I believe this tech sell off here, \[when\] we look back three, six months, I view this as more of a golden opportunity, not the time \[for it\] to head into hibernation mode," Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities told CNBC's "" on Thursday, in the midst of the market downturn.

Other analysts also weighed in on the outlook for the stock.

Apollo Global and KKR still on track to enter S&P 500, eventually, Barclays says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Apollo Global Management](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/APO/) and [KKR & Co.](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KKR/) are both still on track to eventually join the S&P 500 Index, according to a Barclays report to clients out Monday, although the immediate outlook may be diminished by the effect of higher interest rates on both companies' GAAP-reported earnings.

After Blackstone was [admitted to the S&P 500 in September](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackstone-and-airbnb-set-to-join-sp-500-others-to-join-sp-100-sp-midcap-400-and-sp-smallcap-600-301916307.html), "the index inclusion narrative has become increasingly front and center" for alternative asset managers, analyst Benjamin Budish said in the note. The problem for Apollo and KKR, however, is that S&P demands earnings measured by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the most recent quarter, "and in aggregate over the four preceding quarters."

But with interest rates having climbed in the third quarter, "this could result in unrealized losses on APO's/KKR's fixed income investments (largely related to their insurance businesses)," Barclays argued, noting that GAAP earnings for both had been negative in prior quarters that saw 10-year Treasury yields rise by similar magnitudes.
